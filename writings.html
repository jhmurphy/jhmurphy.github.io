            <p align="left">  Looking back on my time at Iowa State reveals that I have been prepared for a job in the real world. There are multiple ways in which this was accomplished.  I think my experiences have mostly helped me to understand how to logically solve problems and develop complex software. My classes have allowed me to work with a team to produce creative solutions to engineering problems. I was able to be a part of a project that could impact the global context when finished and published. The application involved time management, and anyone with a smart phone could potentially use it. I always had to make sure that any decisions that were made were ethical, and the projects that I worked on were always ethical in nature.</p> 
            <p align="left"> The class that really enabled me to analyze contemporary issues on an ethical level was SE 329. We discussed ethical dilemmas that occurred in the work place for software engineers. That class allowed us to have a discussion about the best way to go about handling tough situations ethically. My group was able to take the information we learned and apply it to our final project.</p>
            <p align="left"> One outside resource that I found to be quite beneficial in my learning was Lynda.com. Iowa State allows students free access to all Lynda courses, and there is quite a bit of quality information. I was able to learn web development through Lynda. One other site that was helpful for me this semester was datacamp.com. This is a great website for learning how to work with data science and research. This has helped me greatly in my senior design project.</p>
            <p align="left"> One student organization that I have been a part of since my freshman year has been The Salt Company. Salt is a Christian organization that is based out of Cornerstone Church in Ames. Salt has been beneficial for me spiritually, and it has also taught me a lot. I was able to begin to appreciate learning and studying not only spiritual things but things specific to my major as well because of Salt. As of right now, I am continuing my learning by studying Python. I have been using Python in my senior design project, but I have not extensively worked with Python before. Learning Python to the fullest extent will allow me to be better at writing scripts as well as become a better programmer in general.</p> 
            <p align="left"> If I were to do my undergraduate studies again, I would make sure to get the help I needed earlier. There is no shame in getting help from the TAâ€™s or the professor, and it took me a while to realize this. This would have most likely prevented some long, frustrating hours of trying to understand certain concepts. I think I would also try to get to know more people in my major and in my classes. Having a friend in a class is beneficial, and while I did have this for a lot of my college career, I did not always know someone in my classes.</p>

            <div class="h4 mt-0 title" align="center">General Education Reflection</div>
            <p align="left">The general education classes that I have taken have had a significant impact on the way that I approach problem solving. The classes may not have directly applied to software engineering, but the problem solving techniques that I learned have been invaluable. I would say that the calculus, physics, and chemistry classes that I have taken provided the most insight into working on problems as an engineer. I learned that hands on practice of multiple types of problems is the best way to understand a concept. Another imperative take away was simply the fact that asking for help is always a good option. In the workplace, there will almost always be people around to help with the current problem.</p> 
            <p> The knowledge gained from these courses will ultimately help me to become a better engineer. In a much broader sense, the engineering techniques that I acquired could potentially allow me to make a positive impact on society. I am able to think more critically and creatively in order to help those around me. Engineers provide key services to the world, and I hope to work for a company where I could put my skills to work for others.</p>
            <p>My current short term goal is to get my first full-time job in the Madison, Wisconsin area. The goal in the beginning is to get a stable job that will allow me to pay off a lot of my college loans. As far as a long term goal, I would like to potentially work with developing mobile applications/websites. I am not sure which company I would like to work at long term at this point. Being able to develop software that is directly beneficial towards society would be very rewarding and ultimately my over-arching long term goal.</p>
